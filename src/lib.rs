//! Bevy Loading State Progress Tracking Helper Crate
//!
//! This is a plugin for the Bevy game engine, to help you implement loading states.
//!
//! You might have a whole bunch of different tasks to do during a loading screen, before
//! transitioning to the in-game state, depending on your game. For example:
//!   - wait until your assets finish loading
//!   - generate a world map
//!   - download something from a server
//!   - connect to a multiplayer server
//!   - wait for other players to become ready
//!   - any number of other things...
//!
//! This plugin can help you track any such things, generally, and ergonomically.
//!
//! To use this plugin, add `LoadingPlugin` to your `App`, configuring it for the relevant app states.
//!
//! For assets, load them as normal, and then add their handles to the `AssetsLoading` resource
//! from this crate.
//!
//! For other things, implement them as regular Bevy systems that return a `Progress` struct.
//! The return value indicates the progress of your loading task. You can add such "loading systems"
//! to your loading state's `on_update`, by wrapping them using the `track` function.
//!
//! This plugin will check the progress of all tracked systems every frame, and transition to your
//! next state when all of them report completion.
//!
//! If you need to access the overall progress information (say, to display a progress bar),
//! you can get it from the `ProgressCounter` resource.
//!
//! You can have multiple instances of the plugin for different loading states. For example, you can load your UI
//! assets for your main menu during a splash screen, and then prepare the game session and assets during
//! a game loading screen.
